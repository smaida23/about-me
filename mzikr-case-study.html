    <h1>mZikr – UI/UX Design</h1>

    <div class="case-study-content">
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">mZikr</span> is a thoughtfully designed mobile application that helps users discover and organize Islamic remembrance (zikr) in a simple and efficient way. By combining personalized recommendations with an intuitive interface, the app makes everyday spiritual practice easier and more enjoyable.
      </p>

     <h2>Overview</h2>

Zikr App is a mobile application designed to help users maintain consistency in daily remembrance (zikr). The app focuses on simplicity, calm visuals, and habit-building features such as guided zikr sessions and progress tracking. The goal was to create a peaceful digital space that supports spiritual routines without distractions.

<h2>Problem</h2>

Many users struggle to stay consistent with daily zikr due to:

Lack of structure and reminders

Overly complex or visually noisy religious apps

No clear sense of progress or motivation

Existing solutions often overwhelm users with too many features, reducing focus and usability.

<h2>Goal</h2>

Design a mobile app that:

Encourages daily zikr habits (morning & evening)

Feels calm, minimal, and spiritually respectful

Provides gentle motivation through progress and statistics

Is easy to use for all age groups

<h2>Target Users</h2>

Muslims who want to build or maintain a daily zikr routine

Users who prefer simple, distraction-free apps

Beginners looking for guidance as well as experienced users

<h2>UX Process</h2>

<h3>1. Research & Inspiration</h3>
I analyzed existing zikr and religious apps and identified common pain points:

Too many screens and features

Poor visual hierarchy

Lack of emotional calm

<h3>2. Information Architecture</h3>
The app was structured into clear sections:

Zikr (morning & evening)

Progress tracking

Statistics overview

This ensures users can complete their main task within a few taps.

<h3>3. User Flow</h3>

Open app → Select zikr

Read and complete zikr

Track completion automatically

View progress in statistics

The flow was designed to minimize cognitive load.

<h2>UI Design</h2>

Color Palette: Soft neutrals and warm accent tones to evoke calm and focus

Typography: Clean, readable fonts suitable for Arabic and Latin text

Layout: Card-based design for clarity and accessibility

Visual Style: Minimal, spiritual, and modern

The design avoids unnecessary animations and visual noise to maintain a peaceful experience.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

Guided morning and evening zikr

Progress indicators for completed zikr

Simple statistics to encourage consistency

Intuitive navigation and clean layout

<h2>Outcome</h2>

The final design delivers:

A calm and focused user experience

Clear guidance without overwhelming the user

A balance between spiritual content and modern UX principles

This project demonstrates my ability to design meaningful, user-centered mobile applications with a strong focus on usability, clarity, and emotional experience.
